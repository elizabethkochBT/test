These login options don’t all meet the required security standards and also create frustration and confusion for users.\r\n\r\nThrough our research, we hoped to explore how the VA can most successfully migrate existing users, and onboard new user to Login.gov (which is a compliant, single sign-on credentialing platform). While Login.gov does currently exist, our research hopes to uncover the best ways to support Veterans, non-Veteran roles, and VA staff in this transition.\r\n\r\nWe want to understand:\r\n* how we can intervene to ensure that new generations of Veterans use Login.gov or ID.me to access My HealtheVet from the start.\r\n* what in-person support will enable Veterans to create and use a Login.gov account to access My HealtheVet.\r\n* how the greatest number of Veterans can use multi-factor authentication options, including security keys.\r\n* how setting up and maintaining shared access might work for Veterans and non-Veterans.\r\n\r\n## Key findings\r\n\r\n1. Setting up a new credential is frustrating for Veterans if it's made to seem like a choice or the need is unclear.\r\n2. Knowing humanized and dedicated support is available, motivates Veterans to setup and use a credential.\r\n3. Being identity proofed at another appointment, and, as the start or end to account setup, is more convenient for Veterans\r\n4. Veterans see security as the VA’s responsibility, but are motivated to be more careful if it puts their benefits access at risk, or they understand how their actions affect fellow Veterans.\r\n5. Perceived ease of use and complex views on security inform Veterans' multi-factor authentication choices.\r\n6. Veterans will choose whichever login credential is most familiar, or, seems more direct to complete a task.\r\n7. Veterans don't think to share access to their healthcare information until life altering events make it necessary.\r\n\r\nMore on key findings in this [Research Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research/discovery/login.gov%20adoption%20discovery%20research%20findings.md) document.","createdAt":"2022-10-13T04:49:33Z","number":185,"state":"open","title":"2022-10-Research-LoginGovFieldResearch","url":"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/185"},{"assignees":[{"id":"U_kgDOBtHPdg","is_bot":false,"login":"elizabethkochBT","type":"User"}],"author":{"id":"U_kgDOBtHPdg","is_bot":false,"login":"elizabethkochBT","type":"User"},"body":"## Welcome and Introduction\nWelcome to the Veteran's Administration (VA) Veteran Facing Services (VFS) team! \nAs a new VFS team member, you will be working in the web ecosystem we call the VA.gov Platform (or \"**The Platform,**\" for short).
